## About Me
Hi, I'm Mike. I design and build systems that need to work reliably at scale.
Over the last 7+ years, I’ve worked across software engineering and DevOps, helping teams adopt cloud technologies, automate infrastructure, and deliver faster with confidence.
I'm constantly learning, simplifying complex systems, and sharing what I know.

I currently work as a Learning Engineer at Carnegie Mellon University, where I design and develop hands-on technical courses in Cloud DevOps, Cloud-Native Engineering, and Agentic AI. My work supports learners in the Rapid Occupational Workforce Training Program, including participants in the U.S. Army’s AI Technicians Program.

## What I Love Building
Microservices are my comfort zone. I enjoy turning complex problems into scalable, modular services containerised with Docker and orchestrated with Kubernetes.
If it involves cloud-native patterns and resilient architecture, I’m all in.
